# About the project 
During my study time, I was asked if I would like to attempt to try to build a neuronal network like and see how good it 
I accepted the callenge and reached about 20% accuracy. Here, I share the files I used. 

First, I preprocessed the five files files into 289 smaller batches.  
Then, the files are loaded them into memory one by one to train the neuronal network.
